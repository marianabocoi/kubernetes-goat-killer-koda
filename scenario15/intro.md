Most of the container images download and used on the internet are created by someone else. If we don't know how they get created (which means if we don't have `Dockerfile`) then I think we might be in trouble sometimes. In this scenario, we can see how to analyze the docker container image layers by using the built-in utilities and also some popular open-source utilities like dive to understand the container image layers.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following

1. How to explore, introspect and analyze docker container images
2. Using open source tools like dive to perform container image analysis
3. Able to work with standard command-line utilities
