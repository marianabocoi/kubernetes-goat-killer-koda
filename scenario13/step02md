## Scenario Solution

* This deployment pod has not set any resource limits in the Kubernetes manifests. So we can easily perform the bunch of operations which can consume resources
* In this pod we have installed a utility called `stress-ng`

```bash
stress-ng --vm 2 --vm-bytes 2G --timeout 30s
```

![Scenario 13 stress-ng](./sc-13-2.png)

* You can see the difference between while running `stress-ng` and after

```bash
kubectl top pod hunger-check-deployment-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx
```

![Scenario 13 kubectl top](./sc-13-3.png)

> This attack may not work in some cases like autoscaling, resource restrictions, etc.
