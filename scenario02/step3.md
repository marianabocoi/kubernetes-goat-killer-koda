### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal of this scenario is to escape out of the running docker container to the host system where the container is running and able to access and perform actions on the host system.

:::tip

If you can able to obtain container images in the host system then you have completed this scenario. But definitely, you can advance beyond this exploitation as well by performing post-exploitation.
