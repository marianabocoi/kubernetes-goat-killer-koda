This scenario is useful in performing Kubernetes security audits and assessments. Here you will learn how to run an open-source tool called `Popeye` for the Kubernetes cluster. You will also use the results for the further exploitation or fixing of the misconfigurations and vulnerabilities found. This is very important if you are coming from an audit and compliance background in the modern world of containers, Kubernetes, and cloud native ecosystems.

By the end of the scenario, you will understand and learn the following:

1. You will learn to perform Kubernetes audit for Kubernetes clusters
2. Working with open source utilities to perform audits and investigations of the cluster resources
3. Gain visibility of the entire Kubernetes cluster security posture and understand the risks
