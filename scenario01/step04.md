## Hint 02

Now that we know that there is a git repository, we can clone the git repository in the terminal using the `git-dumper` opensource tool:

```
git-dumper {{TRAFFIC_HOST1_1230}}/.git k8s-goat-git
```

Then navigate to the downloaded git repository folder for further analysis
```
cd k8s-goat-git
```
