## Hint 01

After reading the "Backstory" we deduce there might be something related to code versioning. We can check if the service exposes a `.git` folder.

For example checking the `/.git/config` path on [the service page]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_1230}}/.git/config) shows if we can access the git configuration.
