Developers tend to commit sensitive information to version control systems. As we are moving towards CI/CD and GitOps systems, we tend to forget to identify sensitive information in code and commits. Let's see if we can find something cool here ðŸ˜€

For example we have a service that has been deployed on Kubernetes and serves a page. Can you discover some hidden ecrets that were unintentionally released?
Inspect to this service page here: [Goat Service (port 1230)]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_1230}})

You will use the terminal as support to get the secrets in the following steps.

If the service page above does not load click on the code below:
```
kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=build-code"
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=build-code" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME --address 0.0.0.0 1230:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```{{exec}}

Available ports page:
[ACCESS PORTS]({{TRAFFIC_SELECTOR}})
