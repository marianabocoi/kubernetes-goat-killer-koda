## ðŸ™Œ Overview

The containers and their infrastructure are immutable. It means it's very difficult to detect certain attacks, vulnerabilities, and detections using traditional tools and technologies. In this scenario, we will see how we can leverage the popular open-source tool like Falco to detect and perform runtime security monitoring using the ruleset in action.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following

1. Deploying the helm chart into the Kubernetes cluster
2. Performing the log analysis and detection of security events in the Kubernetes Cluster
3. Use, analyze and detect security issues in near real-time using Falco
