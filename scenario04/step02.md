### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

The goal of this scenario is to escape out of the running docker container on the host system using the available misconfigurations. The secondary goal is to use the host system-level access to gain other resources access and if possible even go beyond this container, node, and cluster-level access.

:::tip

Gain access to the host system and obtain the node level kubeconfig file `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig`, and query the Kubernetes nodes using the obtained configuration.
