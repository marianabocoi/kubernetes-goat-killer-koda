## ðŸ™Œ Overview

This scenario is very useful in performing Kubernetes security audits and assessments. Here we will learn to run an open-source tool called `kubeaudit` for the Kubernetes cluster and use the results for the further exploitation or fixing of the misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. This is very important and mandates if you are coming from an audit and compliance background in the modern world of containers, Kubernetes, and cloud native ecosystems.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following

1. You will learn to perform Kubernetes audit for Kubernetes clusters
2. Working with open source utilities to perform audits and investigations of the cluster resources
3. Gain visibility of the entire Kubernetes cluster security posture and understand the risks
